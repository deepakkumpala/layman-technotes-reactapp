### gRPC


Imagine you're running a fleet of self-driving taxis in different cities. Each taxi (a small system or service) needs to talk to a central system to get:

- Navigation instructions
- Fuel levels
- Passenger bookings
- Software updates

And they need this super fast, with as little delay as possible, because even a second matters on the road.

You try REST API, but it's kind of like sending emails back and forth — it works, but it's slow and bulky for high-speed needs.

gRPC is like giving each taxi a walkie-talkie instead of email.
Now, communication is:

- Instant
- Compact
- Reliable

And happens over a predefined language that both sides understand quickly.

gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) is an open-source framework that lets different services (often in microservices architecture) talk to each other directly and efficiently.

It's based on:

- Protocol Buffers (protobuf) → Binary encoded, a super-lightweight way of structuring data.
- HTTP/2 → for fast streaming and multiplexing.
