## Content Delivery Network (CDN)


A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is like a network of delivery trucks spread across the world. Instead of delivering packages, it delivers website content (like images, videos, or web pages) to users. The goal is to make the content load faster by bringing it closer to the user. For example, if you're in India and the website's server is in the US, a CDN can serve the content from a nearby server in India instead of making you wait for it to come all the way from the US.

CDNs use a network of edge servers located in different regions to cache content closer to users. Frequently accessed content is stored temporarily on edge servers to reduce latency. Minimizes the time it takes for data to travel between the server and the user. Compresses and optimizes files `(e.g., images, videos)` for faster delivery.

> **Netflix**: Uses CDNs to stream videos smoothly to users worldwide by caching content on servers near their locations.
