### Big Bang Deployment

Think of it like renovating your entire house overnight. You pack up, shut everything down, and move all your furniture, appliances, and walls in one go. The next morning, it's a whole new house â€” or chaos if something breaks! But there is a catch. This strategy has high risk. If something breaks, we have to quickly switch everything back. It's tricky task!

Big Bang Deployment is a software deployment strategy where the entire system or application is released all at once into the production environment. All components, services, or modules are switched from the old version to the new version simultaneously, typically during a predefined release window.

In 1992, the London Ambulance Service implemented a new Computer-Aided Dispatch (CAD) system designed to automate the process of assigning ambulances to emergency calls. They opted for a Big Bang Deployment, switching from the manual system to the new automated system all at once.
