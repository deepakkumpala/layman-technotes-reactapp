### .NET Framework

The original implementation of .NET, designed primarily for building Windows desktop and server applications. Used while developing Windows Forms (WinForms) , WPF desktop apps, ASP.NET web applications hosted on IIS, Enterprise applications tightly coupled with Windows. This is not cross-platform. This has slower release cycle compared to newer .NET technologies. Legacy APIs that may not align with modern development practices.

### .NET Core
A modern, cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux), open-source reimplementation of .NET, designed for flexibility and performance. Used while developing cloud-native applications, Cross-platform web applications using ASP.NET Core, Microservices and containerized applications. This is Modular and lightweight (you only include the libraries you need).

### .NET Standard

Provides a common API surface for code sharing across different .NET implementations (.NET Framework, .NET Core, Mono, etc.).Used for writing libraries that work across multiple .NET platforms. Ensures compatibility between different .NET runtimes. Largely replaced by the unified .NET platform (starting with .NET 5).

### Mono
Mono is an open-source implementation of the .NET Framework. It was originally created to allow .NET applications to run on platforms other than Windows, such as Linux, macOS, and mobile operating systems. Mono provides a runtime, libraries, and tools to build and run .NET applications across different platforms. It was a key part of enabling cross-platform development before the introduction of .NET Core and the unified .NET platform.

### Xamarin
Xamarin is a framework built on top of Mono, designed specifically for building cross-platform mobile applications. It allows developers to write apps in C# and share code across iOS, Android, and Windows platforms. Xamarin provides platform-specific APIs and tools to create native user interfaces while sharing the business logic across platforms. It became part of Microsoft in 2016 and is now integrated into the .NET ecosystem as .NET MAUI (Multi-platform App UI), starting with .NET 6.

> To eliminate all this confusion, Microsoft unified the ecosystem by introducing .NET (5 and above) as a cross-platform, forward-looking framework. For backward compatibility, .NET Standard is still supported to ensure shared libraries work across different runtimes.
