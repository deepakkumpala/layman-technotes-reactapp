### Webhooks

Let’s say you're eagerly waiting for a pizza delivery. Now, you could keep calling the pizza place every few minutes asking, "Is it ready yet?" — that’s tiring and inefficient.

Instead, wouldn’t it be better if the delivery person just rang your doorbell the moment your pizza arrived? That way, you don’t have to keep checking — you’re notified only when something important happens.

That’s exactly how webhooks work in the tech world. In technical terms, a webhook is a way for one system to notify another system in real-time when a specific event occurs. It’s like setting up a subscription

> Tip: Webhooks are for server to server communication

#### Real-Time Examples of Webhooks

-  `Twilio` - provides programmable communication tools for making and receiving phone calls, sending and receiving text messages, and performing other communication functions using its web service APIs.

- `GitHub` -  When developer pushes code or opens an issue, GitHub notifies.
