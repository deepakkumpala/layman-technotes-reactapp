### Blue-Green Deployment

Imagine you're at a busy airport. There are two gates (Blue & Green) for the same flight:

Gate A (Blue) is the one currently boarding passengers. Gate B (Green) is being cleaned, upgraded with better seating, a new boarding system, and refreshed screens.

Now, Gate B is Ready and all the updates are done, and it's tested. The boarding announcement suddenly says: "Passengers for Flight 707, please proceed to Gate B." Passengers now board from Gate B (Green). Gate A (Blue) is now empty and can be cleaned, maintained, or prepared for the next flight.

If anything goes wrong at Gate B (new boarding system crashes), the staff just reroute people back to Gate A instantly. No need to rebuild or reconfigure anything.

Blue-Green Deployment is a deployment strategy that maintains two identical production environments:

> - Blue = current live (production) version
> - Green = new version (candidate)

Traffic is switched instantly from blue to green once the new version is fully tested and verified, ensuring zero-downtime deployments and quick rollback.

Websites like E-commerce uses a variation of Blue-Green deployment when releasing updates to critical components like checkout services, which must not go down. They deploy the new version (Green) in a parallel. Then Run full-scale integration and synthetic traffic to test. Once validated, traffic is routed via Application Load Balancer from Blue to Green.

If errors spike in metrics (using CloudWatch + alarms), the switch is reversed immediately back to Blue. This guarantees Zero downtime and Seamless rollback.
