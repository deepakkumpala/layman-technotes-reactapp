### API gateway

Imagine **API gateway** as the front desk at a hotel. It handles everything before guests (requests) go to their rooms (services). It checks IDs, gives room keys, limits visitors, and takes messages. - all in one place.

An API gateway is a single point of entry to the clients of an application. An API gateway typically provides,

> **Request parameter validation**: Checks if the incoming request has all the correct information.  *If a form says "email is required", the gateway rejects blank emails.*


> **Service Discovery**: Knows where to send each request , even if the address changes.  *If a service moved to a new server, the gateway still finds it.*


> **Rate Limit**: Stops users from sending too many requests in a short time.
  *Example: Allows 100 requests per minute from one user — blocks extra ones.*


> **Allow/Deny requests**:  Blocks or allows users based on rules and policies
  *Example: Blocks requests from a suspicious IP or country.*

> **Policy application**: Enforces rules like who can access what and when
  *Example: Client certificate validation and redirection.*

> **Routing**: Sends requests to the correct internal service.
  *Example: Sends login requests to the Auth service*

> **Authentication/Authorization**:Checks who you are and what you're allowed to do
  *Example: You must log in to access your orders — guest users get blocked*

> **Protocol conversion**: Translates one type of message into another
  *Example: Converts WebSocket to HTTP or SOAP to REST*

> **Error handling**: Catches errors and gives friendly or useful responses.
  *If a service fails, it shows a helpful "Try again later" message*

> **Circuit breaking**: If a service keeps failing, it stops sending requests to prevent system crashes.
  *If the payment service is down, it avoids making more calls to it.*

> **Logging** : Keeps track of all incoming and outgoing traffic.
  *Logs every request, response, and error for debugging or monitoring.*
