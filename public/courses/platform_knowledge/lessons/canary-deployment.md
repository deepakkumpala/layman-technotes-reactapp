### Canary Deployment

Like trying a new recipe on just one friend first. You bake a new dish and serve it to a few trusted people. If they love it and feel fine, you serve it to everyone. If not, you stop and fix it.

Canary deployment is a progressive deployment strategy where a new version of an application is released to a small subset of users first (called the "canary group") before rolling it out to the entire user base. This approach allows teams to monitor performance and detect issues early in production, with minimal risk.

This is safer. Only a small group sees changes at first. Needs careful monitoring and setup.
