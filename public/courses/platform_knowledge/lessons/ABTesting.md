## A/B Testing

Imagine you run an online store and want to increase sales. You decide to test two different "Buy Now" buttons:

- Version A: A blue "Buy Now" button.
- Version B: A red "Buy Now" button.

You show the blue button to half your visitors and the red button to the other half. After a week, you find that the red button led to 20% more purchases. This tells you that the red button is more effective, so you decide to use it permanently.

A/B testing helps you make data-driven decisions instead of guessing what works best.

### Example

The test involved creating two versions of the website and dividing the traffic equally between them. For instance, with 10,000 daily visitors, 5,000 saw Version A, and 5,000 saw Version B. After running the test for 10 days, they compared the results: Version A generated 300 leads, while Version B generated 400 leads. Based on the data, they concluded that Version B was more effective.
