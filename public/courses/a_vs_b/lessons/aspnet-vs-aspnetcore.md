### ASP.NET

ASP.NET also known as ASP.NET Framework, is built on the traditional .NET Framework, which runs only on Windows. Its architecture is monolithic and tightly coupled with the System.Web.dll, making it less modular and harder to extend. It supports multiple web development models such as Web Forms, MVC, and Web API, which are maintained as separate components. ASP.NET applications are hosted exclusively on IIS (Internet Information Services) and rely on web.config files for configuration, using XML format. It does not offer built-in dependency injection, so developers typically integrate external DI containers like Unity or Ninject. Due to its dependency on Windows and tight coupling, it isn't suitable for cross-platform development.

### ASP.NET Core

This is a modern, cross-platform web framework built on .NET Core (and later unified under .NET 5, 6, 7, 8). Its architecture is modular and lightweight, built entirely from scratch with no dependency on System.Web.dll. ASP.NET Core unifies MVC and Web API under a single framework, simplifying development. It supports flexible hosting options , it can run on the built-in Kestrel server or be reverse-proxied behind IIS, Nginx, or Apache. Configuration is handled using appsettings.json, environment variables, and strongly-typed objects, offering greater clarity and flexibility. One of its standout features is built-in dependency injection, which is fully supported throughout the framework. Designed with performance in mind, ASP.NET Core is significantly faster and consumes less memory, making it ideal for modern, scalable, and cross-platform web applications.
