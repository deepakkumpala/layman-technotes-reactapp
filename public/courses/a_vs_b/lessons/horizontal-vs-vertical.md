Horizontal and vertical scaling are two ways to handle increased demand on a system, like a website or application, by adding more resources. 

### Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out)

Imagine a restaurant. If more customers come in, you hire more chefs to handle the workload. Similarly, If your website is slow because of too many users, you add more servers to share the load.

Can handle very large growth, no single point of failure (if one server fails, others can take over) but more complex to manage because you need to coordinate between multiple servers.

### Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up)

Instead of hiring more chefs, you upgrade your current chef with better tools and skills to work faster. Like, If your website is slow, you upgrade your server with a faster processor or more memory. Adding more power `(CPU, RAM, etc.)` to your existing machine.

Simpler to implement since youâ€™re just upgrading one machine but Limited by the maximum capacity of a single machine, and if it fails, everything goes down.
