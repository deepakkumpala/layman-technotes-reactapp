### Service Bus

Messages are processed in the exact order they are sent. If you send messages A, B, and C, they will be received and processed in the same order: A → B → C.

How it works: Service Bus uses a concept called message sessions or message sequencing to ensure that messages are delivered in order. Ideal for scenarios where the order of events is critical, like processing financial transactions or booking systems (e.g., a ticketing system where the first booking request must be processed first). 

Think of a single-lane toll booth where cars (messages) must pass one at a time in the exact order they arrive.


#### Queue and Topic in Service Bus

- **Queue**: A queue is a simple point-to-point communication model where a single consumer processes messages. Messages are stored in the queue until they are retrieved and processed by the consumer. Ideal for scenarios where each message is processed by only one receiver, such as task processing or order handling.

- **Topic**: A topic is a publish-subscribe communication model where multiple subscribers can receive messages. Messages are sent to a topic and then delivered to one or more subscriptions. Each subscription can have its own filter rules to receive only specific messages. Suitable for scenarios where multiple systems or services need to react to the same set of messages, like broadcasting notifications or updates.


Think of a queue as a single mailbox where only one person collects the mail, while a topic is like a bulletin board where multiple people can read the same notices.

### Event Hub

Messages sent to the same partition are processed in the order they are sent. However, Event Hub is designed for high-throughput scenarios, so messages are distributed across multiple partitions for scalability. one can specify a partition key when sending events. All events with the same key go to the same partition, ensuring order within that partition. Suitable for scenarios where order matters only within a specific context, like tracking events for a single device or user in an IoT system.

Think of a multi-lane highway where cars with the same color (partition key) stay in the same lane, maintaining order within that lane, but cars in different lanes don’t follow a global order.



In summary:
- Use **Service Bus** when you need reliable message delivery with strict ordering and transactional support.
- Use **Event Hub** when you need to handle high-throughput event streaming with partitioned data for scalability.
