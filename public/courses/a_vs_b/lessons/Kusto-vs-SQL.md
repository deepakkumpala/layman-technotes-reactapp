### Kusto and SQL 

Kusto and SQL are both used to query data, but they’re built for different types of tasks. 

SQL is great for working with structured data in relational databases, think rows and columns in a table, like Excel. It’s been around for decades and is ideal for things like financial records or inventory systems.

Kusto, on the other hand, is designed for fast, large-scale analysis of log and telemetry data what you'd get from monitoring servers or tracking user activity. It's used in tools like Azure Data Explorer and is more flexible with time-based data, making it easier to spot patterns or trends. While SQL focuses on joining tables and filtering data, Kusto is optimized for scanning huge datasets quickly and supports powerful built-in functions for things like summarizing, visualizing, and detecting anomalies.
