### Load Testing

To check how a system performs under expected, normal, or peak usage conditions. Ensure the system can handle the expected number of users or transactions without issues. Imagine you run an e-commerce website. Before a big sale (like Black Friday), you simulate 10,000 users browsing and purchasing items at the same time to ensure the website doesn't slow down or crash.



### Stress Testing

To determine the system's breaking point by pushing it beyond its normal capacity. Identify the maximum limits of the system and how it behaves when overloaded.  Using the same e-commerce website, you simulate 50,000 users (far beyond the expected traffic) to see if the website crashes gracefully or if it causes data loss or other critical failures.
