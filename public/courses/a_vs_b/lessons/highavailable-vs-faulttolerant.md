### High Availability

Think of it like a backup plan. If one part of the system fails, another part quickly takes over so users barely notice any disruption.

Imagine a restaurant with multiple chefs. If one chef gets sick, another chef steps in to keep the kitchen running. There might be a slight delay, but the restaurant stays open.

> Goal: Minimize downtime.

### Fault Tolerance

This is like building a system that can keep working even if something breaks, without any noticeable impact.

Imagine a car with two engines. If one engine fails, the other keeps the car running smoothly without stopping.

> Goal: No downtime at all.
