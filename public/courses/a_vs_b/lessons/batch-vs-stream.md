### Batch Processing

Batch processing involves collecting data over a period of time and processing it all at once. Think of it like doing laundry: you wait until you have a full load of clothes before washing them.

Payroll systems. Employee salaries are calculated and processed at the end of the month.

Data analytics reports. A company processes a large dataset overnight to generate insights.

- When data doesn't need to be processed immediately.
- When processing large volumes of data at once is more efficient.

### Stream Processing

Stream processing handles data in real-time as it arrives. It's like washing dishes one by one as soon as they get dirty.

Fraud detection in banking. Transactions are monitored in real-time to identify suspicious activity.

Live video streaming platforms. Data is processed and delivered to viewers as it is generated.

- When low latency is critical.
- When data needs to be processed continuously.

Stream processing is essential for applications like stock market monitoring, where decisions depend on real-time data.
