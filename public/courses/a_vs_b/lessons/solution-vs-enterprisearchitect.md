### Solution architects 

Solution architects focus on designing and implementing specific solutions to meet business needs, such as creating a software application or integrating systems. They work closely with development teams and stakeholders to ensure the solution aligns with project requirements. 

### Enterprise architects

Enterprise architects on the other hand, take a broader view, defining the overall IT strategy and architecture for the organization. They ensure that all solutions fit within the enterprise's long-term goals and technology standards.

For example, in a retail company, a solution architect might design an e-commerce platform to improve online sales, ensuring it integrates with the inventory system. Meanwhile, the enterprise architect ensures this platform aligns with the company's digital transformation strategy and complies with enterprise-wide security and scalability standards.
