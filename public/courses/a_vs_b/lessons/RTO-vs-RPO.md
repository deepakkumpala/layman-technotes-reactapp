### RTO vs RPO


**RTO (Recovery Time Objective)** is the maximum amount of time your system or application can be down after a failure before it starts causing significant harm to your business. Think of it as the time you have to get things back up and running.

Imagine you run an online store. If your website goes down, how long can it stay offline before you start losing customers or revenue? If your RTO is 2 hours, you need to restore the website within that time.

**RPO (Recovery Point Objective)** is the maximum amount of data you can afford to lose in case of a failure. It defines how far back in time your data recovery point can be.

For the same online store, if your RPO is 30 minutes, it means you can afford to lose up to 30 minutes of sales or customer data. If the system crashes at 3:00 PM, the latest backup should be no older than 2:30 PM.

You own a coffee shop that uses a point-of-sale (POS) system to track orders and payments.

- **RTO**: If the POS system crashes, you decide that it must be fixed within 1 hour to avoid losing customers.
- **RPO**: You can afford to lose up to 15 minutes of transaction data, meaning your backups should be frequent enough to meet this requirement.

By setting RTO and RPO, you can plan your disaster recovery strategy effectively.
