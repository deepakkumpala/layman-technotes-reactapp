# gRPC

Think of gRPC like a super-fast courier service that works best inside a big company’s private system. It’s great for things that need quick, smooth communication, like live chat apps, video calls, or when different parts of a big system (like microservices) need to talk to each other very quickly without delays.

Now imagine REST API as regular mail. It’s easy to send, works with almost everything, and is perfect when you want to share information with the public—like websites or apps that people open in their browsers. It may not be the fastest, but it’s simple and works well when speed isn’t a big deal.


gRPC and REST API (HTTP) are two popular communication protocols for building distributed systems. While REST APIs use HTTP 1.1 and JSON for communication, gRPC leverages HTTP/2 and Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) for efficient and high-performance communication.

gRPC is well-suited for scenarios that demand high performance and real-time communication, such as chat applications and video streaming platforms where low latency and efficient data transmission are crucial. It's also an excellent choice for communication between microservices within a private network, especially in enterprise systems where speed and efficiency are critical. On the other hand, REST APIs are more appropriate for public-facing services, such as web applications accessed through browsers, where broad compatibility and ease of use are important. REST is also ideal for simpler systems where performance is not a primary concern, offering a more straightforward implementation with wide support across platforms and tools.

Imagine you're ordering pizza.

REST API is like calling the pizza shop and placing your order. You hang up and wait for the delivery. You can go do other things while you wait—that's asynchronous. REST often works this way, especially in browsers: you send a request, and when the response comes back, your app handles it.

gRPC is more like staying on the call with the pizza shop while they make your order. You’re waiting and listening the whole time—that’s synchronous, meaning the client and server stay connected and communicate directly until the job is done. However, gRPC also supports asynchronous calls, especially in streaming, but its default style is synchronous request/response, especially between services.


gRPC uses HTTP/2 as its underlying protocol, which allows for features like multiplexing and full-duplex streaming, while REST relies on HTTP/1.1, which has more limited capabilities in that regard. In terms of data format, gRPC uses Protocol Buffers, a compact and efficient binary format, making it faster in performance compared to REST, which typically uses JSON—a text-based format that's easier to read but slower to serialize and transmit. gRPC supports full-duplex streaming, allowing both client and server to send data continuously, whereas REST has limited support for streaming and generally operates in a request-response model. However, REST APIs have the advantage when it comes to tooling and browser compatibility. REST can be easily tested and consumed using standard web tools and works directly in browsers without additional setup. In contrast, gRPC requires predefined Protobuf schemas and often needs a proxy layer to work in browser environments. So, while gRPC is ideal for internal, high-performance microservice communication, REST is more suited for public-facing APIs due to its simplicity and widespread support.




While both gRPC and REST APIs have their strengths, each also comes with certain drawbacks. gRPC, for instance, has a steeper learning curve because it requires developers to understand and define service contracts using Protocol Buffers (Protobuf). Additionally, gRPC has limited native browser support, which means developers often need to use a proxy like gRPC-Web to enable browser-based communication. On the other hand, REST APIs, while easier to use and widely supported, tend to suffer from slower performance due to the overhead of JSON serialization and parsing. Furthermore, REST lacks built-in support for bi-directional streaming, which limits its effectiveness in real-time or interactive use cases compared to gRPC.

## Conclusion
Choose **gRPC** for high-performance, real-time systems and **REST API** for simpler, widely compatible applications. Each has its strengths and weaknesses, so the choice depends on your specific use case.
