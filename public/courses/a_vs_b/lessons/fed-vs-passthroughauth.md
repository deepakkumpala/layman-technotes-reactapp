### Federated Authentication

This method relies on an external identity provider, such as Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS). When a user attempts to log in, Azure AD redirects the user to the federated identity provider (e.g., HealthyCorp's ADFS). ADFS authenticates the user, and if successful, sends a SAML token back to Azure AD for validation. The authentication process happens on-premises or through a third-party identity provider, providing more customization and control over the authentication process, such as enforcing multi-factor authentication (MFA) or smart card logins.

Requires setting up and maintaining an identity federation service (e.g., ADFS) on-premises or with a third-party federation provider. This can involve more complex setup and maintenance but provides more advanced authentication capabilities and more granular control.

Users are redirected to an external identity provider, which may involve a custom login page and additional steps like smart card authentication or multi-factor authentication (MFA).

Federated Authentication is ideal for organizations with complex authentication requirements, such as the need for custom sign-in experiences, advanced security policies (e.g., MFA, smart cards), or integration with third-party identity providers.

### Pass-through Authentication

In this method, Azure AD uses a lightweight agent installed on-premises that passes the authentication request directly to the on-premises Active Directory. When a user logs in, Azure AD passes the login request to the on-premises AD, where the user's credentials are validated. The authentication happens in real-time on the on-premises infrastructure, and there’s no need for an external identity provider like ADFS.

Requires a simpler setup with only the installation of a pass-through authentication agent on-premises. This method doesn’t require a separate identity federation service, making it easier to deploy, but it limits some of the customization options available in federated authentication.

Pass-through Authentication is ideal for organizations that need a simple, low-maintenance authentication method, where the primary requirement is seamless authentication using the same on-premises credentials, without the need for extra infrastructure or custom policies.
