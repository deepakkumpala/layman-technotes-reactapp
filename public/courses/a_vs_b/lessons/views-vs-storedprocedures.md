### Views

Imagine you're in a restaurant's kitchen. There's a window that only shows you the dessert section. You can peek through that window anytime and see the latest desserts, but you can't cook or change anything through it. That's a View.

A virtual table based on a SELECT query. It simplifies complex queries by encapsulating them into a single object. Primarily used for reading data.
Does not store data and fetches data dynamically when queried. Cannot include procedural logic (e.g., loops, conditions). And, view's are Read-only (mostly)

### Stored Procedures


Now imagine the head chef gives you a recipe card that says, 

> - Chop onions
> - Boil water
> - Add pasta
> - Serve when soft

You follow the steps and it does something. Thatâ€™s a Stored Procedure, a reusable cooking script.

It's a precompiled set of SQL statements stored in the database. Automates repetitive tasks and encapsulates business logic. Can perform both read and write operations, including complex logic. Precompiled for faster execution.Supports variables, loops, conditions, and error handling. It also takes inputs.
