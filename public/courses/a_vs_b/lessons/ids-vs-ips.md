### Intrusion Detection System


Think of it as a watchful guard that monitors everything happening in your network or system. If it sees something suspicious, like a burglar trying to break in, it raises an alarm. However, it doesn’t stop the burglar, it just tells you something bad might be happening so you can take action.

### Intrusion Prevention System

This is like a guard that not only watches but also takes action. If it sees a burglar, it doesn’t just raise an alarm—it actively blocks the burglar from getting in.

Example Tool: Palo Alto Networks Firewall

As technology evolves, IDS and IPS are becoming smarter with the help of artificial intelligence and machine learning. They’re learning to detect new, more sophisticated threats faster and more accurately. In the future, they might even predict attacks before they happen, making networks safer without human intervention.


IDS + IPS + AI + cloud in one package is the future! Tools like CrowdStrike Falcon, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Fortinet FortiGate
