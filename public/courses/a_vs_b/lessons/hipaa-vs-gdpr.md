## HIPAA vs GDPR

HIPAA stands for the **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act**. It is a U.S. law designed to protect sensitive patient health information. HIPAA ensures that healthcare providers, insurance companies, and other entities handle medical data securely and maintain patient privacy.

If you visit a doctor in the U.S., HIPAA ensures that your medical records are not shared without your consent. For instance, your doctor cannot share your health condition with your employer unless you authorize it.

GDPR stands for the **General Data Protection Regulation**. It is a European Union law that protects the personal data and privacy of individuals. GDPR applies to any organization that processes the personal data of EU citizens, even if the organization is outside the EU.

If you sign up for an online service in Europe, GDPR ensures that the company cannot use your email or personal details for marketing without your explicit consent. You also have the right to request the deletion of your data.
