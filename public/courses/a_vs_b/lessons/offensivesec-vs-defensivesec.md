### Offensive Security

Imagine testing the locks on your house by trying to break in yourself. If you find a weak lock, you replace it before a burglar can exploit it.

Think of offensive security as playing the role of an ethical hacker. The goal is to find vulnerabilities in systems before malicious hackers do. It’s proactive and focuses on attacking systems to identify weaknesses.

- Penetration Testing: Simulating attacks on a web application to find vulnerabilities like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).

- Red Teaming: Acting like a real-world attacker to test an organization’s overall security posture.

### Defensive Security

This is like installing strong locks, security cameras, and alarms in your house to keep burglars out.

Defensive security is about protecting systems from attacks. It’s reactive and focuses on building strong defenses to prevent breaches.

- Firewalls: Blocking unauthorized access to a network.
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): Monitoring network traffic for suspicious activity.

- Blue Teaming: Defending against attacks and responding to incidents.

### Tools Examples:

- SIEM (e.g., Splunk)
- MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)
- Encryption tools
