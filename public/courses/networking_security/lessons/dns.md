### Domain Name System 

Think about how we use mobile phones. Each person has their own unique phone number. At first, you might remember your close friends’ numbers by heart. But as your list of contacts grows, it gets hard to remember them all. So, you save everyone’s number in your phone’s contact list—like a personal phone book. Now, whenever you want to call someone, you don’t need to remember their number—you just tap their name.

The internet works in a similar way. Every computer or website has a unique address called an IP address (like 104.18.2.119). But just like phone numbers, IP addresses are hard to remember. That’s why we use easy names like google.com instead.

To make this work, the internet needs its own phone book that knows which name belongs to which IP address. This is where DNS (Domain Name System) comes in. It’s like the internet’s phone book that helps your computer find the right website when you type in a name.

The Domain Name System (DNS) is like the Internet’s address book. It helps turn easy-to-remember website names into the actual IP addresses that computers use to find each other. This process happens behind the scenes, so users don’t notice it. When you type a website name into your browser, the browser asks the DNS system to find the matching IP address. Once it gets the correct address, your request is sent to the right web server.

DNS relies on caching at multiple levels to speed up responses and reduce the time it takes for users to access websites. Caching is crucial because it helps minimize the load on the DNS infrastructure, which handles billions of queries across the Internet every day.

DNS is organized in a hierarchical structure of name servers. This layered design makes the system highly scalable, allowing it to efficiently handle the growing number of domain names and the increasing volume of user requests.

DNS caching occurs at various levels to improve performance and reduce the load on DNS infrastructure. At the browser level, your web browser (such as Chrome or Firefox) stores DNS results temporarily. This allows for faster access to frequently visited websites since it doesn't need to query DNS servers each time you visit a site. If a website's IP address is cached, the browser can use it directly without asking the operating system or a DNS server. At the operating system (OS) level, your computer also keeps a DNS cache. This cache is used by various applications, not just the browser, to quickly resolve domain names into IP addresses. The OS checks its cache before making a query to external DNS servers, which further speeds up the process. Additionally, local DNS servers (usually set up by your network or home router) maintain their own caches, storing the results of DNS queries for a longer period. When you query a website, the local DNS server can respond immediately if it has the requested IP address in its cache, saving time and reducing the load on higher-level DNS servers. Lastly, ISP (Internet Service Provider) DNS servers cache DNS results for even longer periods, allowing users in the same area to share cached information. This helps reduce the overall number of DNS queries sent out to the broader internet, improving response times for everyone.
