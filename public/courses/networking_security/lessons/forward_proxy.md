### Forward Proxy

You want to send a letter to someone, but you don't want them to know your address. So, you give the letter to your friend (the proxy), and they send it on your behalf. The reply comes to your friend first, then to you. This way, your identity is hidden, and your friend can even choose what messages to send or block.
