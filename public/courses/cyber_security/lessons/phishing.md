# Phishing

## What is Phishing?

Phishing is a cyberattack where attackers pretend to be someone trustworthy to trick you into giving away sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, or personal data.

Think of it as digital fishing - the attacker casts out bait (a fake message), hoping you'll bite!

## How Does Phishing Work?

### The Attack Flow:

1. **Attacker sends a fake message** (email, text, or social media)
2. **Message looks legitimate** (mimics banks, companies, or people you know)
3. **Creates urgency or fear** ("Your account will be closed!" or "You've won a prize!")
4. **Contains a malicious link or attachment**
5. **Victim clicks and enters sensitive information**
6. **Attacker steals the information**

## Common Phishing Examples

### Email Phishing
**Example**: "Your bank account has been locked. Click here to verify your identity."
- Fake email that looks like it's from your bank
- Link goes to a fake website that steals your credentials

### Spear Phishing
**Example**: "Hi John, I'm the new IT manager. Can you send me the client database?"
- Targeted attack using your personal information
- Attacker researched you specifically

### Whaling
**Example**: Email to CEO: "Urgent wire transfer needed for acquisition deal"
- Targets high-profile individuals (executives, VIPs)
- Often involves large financial transactions

### Smishing (SMS Phishing)
**Example**: "Package delivery failed. Click to reschedule: bit.ly/xxx"
- Phishing via text message
- Often uses shortened links to hide destination

### Vishing (Voice Phishing)
**Example**: Phone call: "This is Microsoft support. Your computer has a virus."
- Phishing over phone calls
- Impersonates tech support or government agencies

## Red Flags of Phishing

ðŸš© **Urgency or Threats**: "Act now or your account will be deleted!"
ðŸš© **Generic Greetings**: "Dear Customer" instead of your name
ðŸš© **Suspicious Links**: Hover over links to see real destination
ðŸš© **Poor Grammar**: Typos and awkward language
ðŸš© **Requests for Personal Info**: Legitimate companies won't ask for passwords via email
ðŸš© **Too Good to Be True**: "You've won $1 million!"
ðŸš© **Mismatched Email Addresses**: support@amaz0n.com instead of amazon.com

## Real-World Example

**Fake Email:**
```
From: security@paypa1.com (notice the "1" instead of "l")
Subject: Urgent: Verify Your Account

Dear Valued Customer,

We detected unusual activity on your account. Your account
will be locked in 24 hours unless you verify your identity.

Click here to verify: http://paypal-verify.malicious-site.com

Thank you,
PayPal Security Team
```

**What's Wrong:**
- Misspelled domain (paypa1.com)
- Generic greeting
- Creates urgency and fear
- Suspicious link to external site
- Real PayPal would never ask you to verify via email

## How to Protect Yourself

### Before Clicking:
âœ… **Verify the sender** - Check email address carefully
âœ… **Hover over links** - See where they really go
âœ… **Check for HTTPS** - Secure websites use HTTPS
âœ… **Be skeptical** - Question unexpected messages

### If Suspicious:
âœ… **Don't click links** - Go directly to the website instead
âœ… **Contact the company** - Use official phone numbers
âœ… **Report phishing** - Forward to security teams
âœ… **Delete the message** - Don't keep it around

### Best Practices:
âœ… **Use multi-factor authentication** - Extra security layer
âœ… **Keep software updated** - Patches security vulnerabilities
âœ… **Use password managers** - They won't autofill on fake sites
âœ… **Security awareness training** - Stay informed about latest tactics

## If You've Been Phished

1. **Don't panic** - Act quickly but calmly
2. **Change passwords immediately** - For all affected accounts
3. **Enable 2FA** - Add extra security
4. **Monitor accounts** - Watch for suspicious activity
5. **Report it** - To your bank, company IT, authorities
6. **Scan for malware** - If you downloaded anything
7. **Alert contacts** - If your email was compromised

## Key Takeaway

Phishing is like a con artist wearing a disguise. They pretend to be someone you trust to steal your valuable information. The best defense is being skeptical and verifying before you trust. Remember: When in doubt, don't click!
