# Spam vs Spim

## What is Spam?

Spam is unsolicited, unwanted email sent in bulk to a large number of recipients. Think of it as the digital version of junk mail that clutters your physical mailbox.

### Common Types of Spam:

- **Commercial Spam**: Advertisements for products or services
- **Scam Spam**: Fake lottery wins, inheritance schemes
- **Phishing Spam**: Attempts to steal personal information
- **Malware Spam**: Contains viruses or malicious attachments

### Spam Example:
```
Subject: CONGRATULATIONS!!! YOU'VE WON $1,000,000!!!

You have been selected to receive $1,000,000 from our
international lottery! To claim your prize, send us your
bank details and $500 processing fee.

## What is Spim?

Spim is spam delivered through instant messaging platforms instead of email. The name comes from **SP**am + **IM** (Instant Messaging).

### Where Spim Appears:

- **WhatsApp**: Unsolicited messages from unknown numbers
- **Facebook Messenger**: Random message requests
- **Telegram**: Spam from bots or unknown users
- **Discord**: Unwanted DMs or server invites
- **SMS/Text Messages**: Also called "smishing" when malicious

### Spim Example:
```
WhatsApp Message from Unknown Number:

"Hi! I'm Sarah from XYZ company. We have an amazing
investment opportunity for you! 200% returns guaranteed!
Click this link to join: [suspicious link]"
```

## Key Differences

| Aspect | Spam | Spim |

| **Personal** | Less personal, generic | Can feel more personal/intrusive |
