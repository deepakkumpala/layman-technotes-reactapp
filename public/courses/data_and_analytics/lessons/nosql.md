### NoSQL Databases

NoSQL databases are non-relational databases designed to handle large volumes of unstructured, semi-structured, or structured data. Unlike traditional relational databases, NoSQL databases do not rely on a fixed schema, making them highly flexible and scalable.

NoSQL databases are best suited for semi-structured data where data entries vary in their schema. For example, one user might have name and address, and anouther user might have additional information like phone number , gender etc. NoSQL databases can accomodate such data's and provide faster searches.

NoSQL databases are ideal for scenarios where flexibility, scalability, and performance are critical, especially when dealing with large-scale or rapidly evolving datasets.
