### Materialized View

You are building a project dashboard where you need to display the current status of tasks, bugs, and code reviews. Every time someone opens the dashboard, the system has to go through multiple complex queries to fetch the most up-to-date data from the database.
Doing this from scratch every time would take a lot of time, especially when you have a lot of data and complex calculations involved. Think of a materialized view like a pre-compiled report that you prepare in advance. Instead of pulling the data from the database every time someone looks at the dashboard, you generate and store that report (or data snapshot) ahead of time. However, if the data changes (for example, a new bug is reported, or a task is completed), you need to refresh the report so it reflects the most recent information.


The materialized view stores a pre-calculated snapshot of data, so you don't have to go through the complex queries every time you need it. It speeds up access to data because you're not recalculating everything every timeâ€”it's ready to go. You may need to refresh the materialized view periodically to ensure it has the latest data.

Imagine you have a database of sales records, and you frequently need to calculate the total sales for each month. Instead of running the query every time, you can create a materialized view that stores the monthly totals. When you need the data, you simply read it from the materialized view.

This is especially useful for,

- Reporting: Where the same data is needed repeatedly.
- Performance Optimization: To avoid running expensive queries over and over.


### How It's Different from Regular Views?

When you want , lways Up-to-Date (Real-Time Data) people use Views. Think of a view like a live webcam feed, whenever you open it, you're seeing exactly what's happening right now. But materialized view like a snapshot, it shows what things looked like at the time it was last updated. And, Views are not stored physically in the database, they are just saved SQL queries.
