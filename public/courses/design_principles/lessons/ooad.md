### OOAD

Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) is a way of thinking about and designing software by focusing on "objects" in the real world. 

**Object-Oriented**: Imagine breaking down a problem into smaller, manageable pieces, where each piece represents something from the real world. For example, if you're designing a library system, you might think of objects like "Book," "Member," and "Librarian." These objects have,

- Attributes: Characteristics or properties (e.g., a "Book" has a title, author, and ISBN).
- Behaviors: Actions they can perform (e.g., a "Member" can borrow or return books).

**Analysis**: This is the "thinking" phase. You study the problem and figure out what objects are involved, what they need to do, and how they interact. It's like planning a blueprint before building a house.

**Design**: This is the "planning" phase. You decide how to organize these objects in your software. You define their relationships, responsibilities, and how they communicate. For example, A "Member" might have a relationship with "Book" (e.g., borrowing a book).
A "Librarian" might manage the "Books" and "Members." , By focusing on objects, OOAD makes software easier to understand, maintain, and extend because it mirrors how we think about the real world.
