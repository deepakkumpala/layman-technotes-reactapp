### 2 Phase Commit

Imagine you're organizing a group lunch with friends, and you want to ensure everyone agrees on the restaurant before making a reservation. 

- Prepare Phase (Ask for Agreement):
    You (the coordinator) call each friend and ask, "Are you okay with going to Restaurant X?"

If all friends say "Yes," you move to the next step.
If even one friend says "No," the plan is canceled.

- Commit Phase (Finalize the Plan):
    Once everyone agrees, you call the restaurant and confirm the reservation.

This ensures that either everyone agrees and the plan goes ahead, or nothing happens at all (atomicity).

Imagine a banking system where money is transferred between two accounts:

Prepare Phase: The system checks if both accounts can handle the transaction (e.g., sufficient balance).
Commit Phase: If both checks pass, the system deducts money from one account and adds it to the other.
If any step fails (e.g., insufficient funds), the transaction is rolled back, and no changes are made.

The Two-Phase Commit (2PC) is a protocol used to ensure all-or-nothing execution of a transaction across multiple systems or services

 The Two-Phase Commit protocol is ideal for tightly coupled systems where strong consistency is critical, and the number of participants is limited. Examples include:  

- **Banking systems:** Ensuring atomicity in fund transfers between accounts.  
- **Inventory management:** Coordinating updates between a central inventory system and a warehouse database.  
- **Enterprise applications:** Scenarios where all participants are within the same trusted network and performance is not a primary concern.  

While 2PC ensures strict consistency, its blocking nature and lack of scalability make it unsuitable for distributed microservices architectures.

#### Why It's Not Ideal for Microservices?

In a distributed system (like microservices), waiting for everyone to agree can cause delays or even block the system if one service is slow or unresponsive. This is why alternatives like event-driven architectures are often preferred.
