#### Flipped interaction


Flipped interaction in the context of Agentic AI refers to a scenario where the AI takes a more proactive role in the interaction, rather than just responding to user commands. Instead of waiting for instructions, the AI anticipates needs, suggests actions, or even initiates tasks based on its understanding of the situation.

Imagine you have a personal assistant AI. In a traditional setup, you would ask it to remind you about a meeting or to book a table at a restaurant. In a flipped interaction, the AI might notice that you have a meeting scheduled during lunch and proactively suggest rescheduling or ordering food in advance. It acts more like a partner that thinks ahead, rather than just a tool you use.


Consider a smart home assistant. If it notices that you usually turn on the heater at 7 PM during winter, it might start doing it automatically without being asked. Or, if it detects that you're running late for work based on your calendar and traffic updates, it might suggest leaving earlier or offer to notify your colleagues.

This proactive behavior is what makes the interaction "flipped", the AI takes the lead in certain situations to make your life easier.

The name "flipped interaction" in AI refers to a reversal of the traditional user-AI dynamic. Instead of the user asking questions and the AI responding, the roles are flipped. The AI asks questions, and the user provides answers

In traditional AI usage, a user might say
>“Create a fitness plan for me.”

The AI responds with a generic workout routine.

But in a flipped interaction, the user prompts:

> “Ask me questions until you have enough information to create a personalized fitness plan.”

Now, the AI takes the lead:
- “What are your fitness goals?”
- “Do you have any injuries or limitations?”
- “How many days per week can you train?”
- “Do you prefer gym workouts or home exercises?”

This approach allows the AI to gather context dynamically and tailor its output with greater precision. It’s no longer just responding—it’s interviewing the user to co-create a solution.
