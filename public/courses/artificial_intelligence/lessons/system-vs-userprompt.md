User prompt and system prompt are two distinct concepts in the context of AI interactions. A user prompt refers to the input or query provided by the user to the AI system. It is the direct instruction or question that guides the AI on what the user wants. For example, if you ask an AI, "What is the capital of France?" that is a user prompt. On the other hand, a system prompt is a predefined instruction or configuration given to the AI to shape its behavior or responses. For instance, a system prompt might instruct the AI to always respond in a formal tone or to act as a teacher explaining concepts.

In real-time scenarios, consider a chatbot on a customer service website. When you type, "How can I reset my password?" that is your user prompt. Meanwhile, the system prompt might have been set by the developers to ensure the chatbot responds politely and provides step-by-step instructions. Together, the user prompt and system prompt work in tandem to create meaningful and contextually appropriate interactions.
