### Embedding models, Vector database and RAG

In recent years, artificial intelligence has become much better at understanding human language. But instead of just matching words, modern systems try to understand meaning. To do this, they use something called embedding models. These models take text—like a sentence or a question and turn it into a list of numbers called a vector. This vector represents the meaning of the text in a way that computers can compare. For example, the words "doctor" and "nurse" will have similar vectors because they're related in meaning. This process helps AI systems understand not just what you say, but what you mean.

Once we have these vectors, we need a smart way to store and search them. That's where vector databases come in. These are special databases designed to hold vectors and find similar ones quickly. So if you ask a question, the system can look through the database and find pieces of information that are semantically similar, even if they don't use the exact same words. This is very useful for things like search engines, recommendation systems, and chatbots that need to find relevant content fast.

Now, to make AI even more powerful, we use a method called Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This combines the two ideas above, it first uses a vector database to find useful information related to your question, and then gives that information to a language model (like ChatGPT). The model uses both its own knowledge and the retrieved data to generate a better, more accurate answer. This way, the AI doesn't just guess, it looks up real information and explains it clearly. RAG is widely used in modern AI systems to improve answers, especially when dealing with large documents or specialized topics.

Let's say you upload some content, maybe it's a Word document, a spreadsheet, or even a webpage. This content gets broken down into smaller pieces, like paragraphs or sentences. Then, an embedding model steps in and turns each of those pieces into a set of numbers called vectors. These vectors capture the meaning of the text, so the system can understand what each part is about.

Next, these vectors are stored in a vector database, which is like a huge digital warehouse. Inside this warehouse, similar pieces of information naturally group together into clusters. For example, if your document talks about travel, food, and money, you'll end up with clusters for cities, dishes, and prices. It's like organizing your closet—shirts go in one section, shoes in another, and jackets in their own space.

Now, when you ask a question, like “What’s the average cost of dinner in Paris?”—the language model doesn’t just guess. It goes into the vector database, finds the cluster related to food and prices, and pulls out the most relevant information. It’s like searching for your friend at a party- if you know she loves karaoke, you’ll check the stage first. That’s how the system knows where to look and how to give you the best answer.
