### Test Time Compute

Test Time Compute refers to the amount of computing power and time an AI model uses after it's trained, when it's actually being used to answer questions, generate text, or perform tasks.
Think of it like this,

- Training time is like teaching a student,lots of effort, long hours, and deep learning.
- Test time is like the student taking an exam or solving a problem using what they've learned.

So, Test Time Compute is the energy and brainpower the AI uses while solving problems, not while learning.

Some newer AI models, like OpenAI’s o1, are designed to “think slower” and more deeply during test time. This means they use more compute power to reason through complex questions, kind of like taking extra time to solve a tricky puzzle. This approach can lead to better answers, but it also means the model needs more resources (like powerful GPUs) every time it’s used.
