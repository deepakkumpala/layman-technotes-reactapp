#### Multi-model interaction

Multi-model interaction in the context of agentic AI refers to the ability of an AI system to work with and combine multiple types of models or data sources to achieve a goal. These models could include language models, vision models, audio models, or even specialized models for tasks like weather prediction or financial analysis. The "agentic" part means the AI acts like an agent, it can make decisions, take actions, and interact with its environment to accomplish tasks.

Imagine you have a personal assistant who can do more than just one thing. For example, this assistant can:

- Understand text (like reading emails or documents).
- Recognize images (like identifying objects in photos).
- Process audio (like understanding spoken commands).
- Make decisions (like planning your day based on your calendar and the weather).

Now, instead of these abilities working separately, they all work together. For instance, if you ask your assistant to "Plan a picnic for this weekend," it might,

- Use a language model to understand your request.
- Use a weather prediction model to check if it will rain.
- Use a map model to find nearby parks.
- Use a calendar model to check your availability.

By combining these models, the assistant can give you a complete answer: "It will be sunny on Saturday. There's a park 10 minutes away, and you're free in the afternoon. Shall I prepare a checklist for the picnic?"

Think of a self-driving car,

- It uses a vision model to detect pedestrians, traffic lights, and road signs.
- It uses a navigation model to plan the best route.
- It uses a decision-making model to decide when to stop, turn, or accelerate.

All these models interact seamlessly to ensure the car drives safely and efficiently. This is multi-model interaction in action.

In agentic AI, the system doesn't just passively respondâ€”it actively combines these models to make decisions and take actions, much like a human would when solving a complex problem.
